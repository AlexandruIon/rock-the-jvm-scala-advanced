  //############# Use _* to adapt a sequence

  // you can use Scalaâ€™s _* operator to adapt a sequence (Array, List, Seq, Vector, etc.)
  // so it can be used as an argument for a varargs field:
  //This operator tells the compiler to pass each element of the sequence to printAll as a
  // separate argument, instead of passing fruits as a single argument.


  // a sequence of strings
  var fruits = List("apple", "banana", "cherry")

  //pass the sequence to the varargs field
  printAll(fruits: _*)
