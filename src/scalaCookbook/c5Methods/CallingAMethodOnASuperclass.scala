  //In the basic use case, the syntax to invoke a method in an immediate parent class is the same as Java:
  // Use super to refer to the parent class, and then provide the method name.

  //Controlling which trait you call a method from

  // you can choose which trait to run the method from with the super[traitName].methodName syntax.
  //  Note that when using this technique, you canâ€™t continue to reach up through the parent class
  //  hierarchy unless you directly extend the target class or trait using the extends or with keywords
